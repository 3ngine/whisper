# Whisper

**Whisper** is a powerful C# Windows Forms application designed to scan network ports with ease. Whisper allows users to conduct TCP and UDP scans, detect basic services running on open ports, and adjust scan speed for optimal performance.

## Features

- **TCP and UDP Port Scanning**: Select between TCP and UDP port scans to get a comprehensive view of the target's open ports.
- **Service Detection**: Whisper identifies services running on open ports using basic banner grabbing techniques.
- **Adjustable Scan Speed**: Choose from Fast, Normal, and Slow scan speeds to control the delay between port scans, balancing accuracy and performance.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor scan progress through a progress bar for better user feedback on longer scans.
- **Detailed Results**: Separate list displays all scanned ports, highlighting open ports and their identified services.
